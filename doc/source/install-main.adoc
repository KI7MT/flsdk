There are as many ways to set-up a development environment as there are Linux
distributions in circulation. The {prog} approach takes the path of least 
resistance, or at least, that is the intention.

Installation is the same for all supported distributions, with just a few minor
differences. For clarity, each section will be described in whole.

To allow for different levels of customization, there are three categories of
action:

[horizontal]
[red]*Required*:: Must be installed or acted upon
[fuchsia]*Recommended*:: Not mandatory, but considered useful
[green]*Optional*:: Perform at users discretion

This guide was written with the assumption all three categories will be installed
/ acted upon, where appropriate. It is purely up to the user what to choose.
